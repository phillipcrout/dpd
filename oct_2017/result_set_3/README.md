It was decided that 300k steps produced (to within resolvable levels) accurate results if 1M steps was taken as a base truth. Thus the results presented here are for 300k steps.

Having established the qualtiy of resolution for $\Delta$ A in the 1M set we relocate our attention towards the variabilty in B.

With this in mind we select the following B values as our 'centrals'

30 40 45 50 70 

with three A values each, namely an 'on the line' and those at $\pm$ 2 from the line*.

As such we run 15 simulations, analysing the data as before. This is still at $r_{d}$ = 0.75


* The line is currently A = 0.107 * B + 17.86
