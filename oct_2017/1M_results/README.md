Our hypothesis produced in early work was that the phase line goes through the point ([A,B]) [-20,20] and [-27.5,90].

The would suggest that we suspect a gradient of 0.107 for an incremental increase in B. And thus phase changes at 

[-24.07,58]
[-24.18,59]
and
[-24.29,60]

In actuality we find a phase change at A = -24 , unclear results at A = -23 and liquids at A = -22 for all B under consideration.
This experiment suggests we probably can resolve Liquid/Gas to within A+- 1 ; however it looks likely that we would need a slightly
wider range for B.
