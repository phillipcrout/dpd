## Understanding the Files

files of the form xx_yydump_1.png are samples run at 10k cycles with xx the B value and yy the A value
dump_15_20 is 20,000 timesteps for B = 60 and A = -22.5 ~ although we don't know what step this is at
dump_15_xx is 40,000 timesteps for B = 60 and A = -22.5 ~ although we don't what step this is at

## Discussion

These images contain analysis over two dimensions, the first is the value of **A**
